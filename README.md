Blackjack API - README
üìÑ Project Overview
This project consists of building an API for a Blackjack game using Java with Spring Boot. The API connects to and manages data within two databases: MongoDB and MySQL. The application covers full Blackjack gameplay functionality, including player management, handling of cards, and adherence to Blackjack rules.

The application is designed to be fully reactive, using Spring WebFlux, and includes testing, documentation, and error handling features.

üíª Technologies Used
Java
Spring Boot (for building the REST API)
Spring WebFlux (for reactive programming)
MongoDB (to store player information)
MySQL (to manage game session data)
Swagger/OpenAPI (for API documentation)
Maven (for dependency management)
üìã Requirements
Java 11 or higher
Maven 3.6 or higher
MongoDB v4.4+
MySQL v8.0+
IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)
Windows (development environment)
üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Clone the repository:

Copia el codi
git clone https://github.com/arnaufata/BlackJack-API.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Copia el codi
cd Blackjack-API
Install dependencies using Maven:
